# AL Radio

Community driven radio station with host AL.

AL Radio uses `gpt-4o-mini` to generate an introduction for each song and OpenAI's Text-to-Speech models to announce it.

AL Radio uses the Spotify API to gather song metadata and recommendations based off of previous songs as to maintain a general genre

AL Radio accepts song requests in the form of a search query, a Spotify Track ID, or a Spotify Track URL. These requests are given priority over the recommendation algorithm, allowing users to shift the genre of the station over time.
